# CS5720 - Neural Networks Assignment 1 - Question 4

## Overview
This repository contains the code for **Question 4** of the **CS5720 - Neural Networks** assignment. In this task, we explore the effects of different optimizers (Adam and SGD) on the training of an MNIST classifier.

## Objectives
- Train a model using two different optimizers: **Adam** and **SGD**.
- Compare the performance of these optimizers in terms of accuracy.
- Observe and analyze the training/validation accuracy curves.

## Questions to Answer
1. **What patterns do you observe in the training and validation accuracy curves?**
   - [Answer here once you observe the trends]
   
2. **How can you use TensorBoard to detect overfitting?**
   - [Answer here with your findings]
   
3. **What happens when you increase the number of epochs?**
   - [Answer here based on your experiment results]

## Setup Instructions
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher). You also need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib
